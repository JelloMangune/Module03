            <p>Queen Elizabeth II held the record for most visits to the Élysée Palace for a foreign sovereign. At various occasions, including the six state visits she made to France, the Queen has met with all eight presidents of the French Fifth Republic, which was established in 1959, according to the statement. The Queen was fluent in French and made several public speeches in French while visiting the country.“She who stood with the giants of the twentieth century on the path of history has now left to join them,” the statement said.

            <p>News that the queen's health was deteriorating emerged shortly after midday on Thursday when her doctors said she was under medical supervision, prompting her family to rush to Balmoral Castle in Scotland to be by her side. Thousands gathered outside Buckingham Palace, in central London, and there was a stunned silence when the flag was lowered to half-mast. The crowd surged to the gates as the notice announcing the death of the only monarch most Britons have ever known was attached to the black iron gates</p>

        <section>
            <p>The queen, whose husband died last year, had been suffering from what Buckingham Palace had called "episodic mobility problems" since the end of last year, forcing her to withdraw from nearly all her public engagements.Her last official duty came only on Tuesday, when she appointed Truss prime minister - the 15th of her reign. "The death of Her Majesty the Queen is a huge shock to the nation and to the world," Truss said outside her Downing Street office where the flag, like those at royal palaces and government buildings across Britain, were lowered."Through thick and thin, Queen Elizabeth II provided us with the stability and the strength that we needed. She was the very spirit of Great Britain – and that spirit will endure," said Truss, who was informed of the death at 4:30 p.m. London time.</p>
